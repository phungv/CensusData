##### Step 1: Download Data File

###### Data source: [Census Bureau ACS Summary File 5 Year- 2018 ](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/summary_file/2018/)

> The **Census**  publish a summary file for the American Community Survey every year and provides it in a 5 year average and 1 year average. For snapshot data, I use the 5 year summary file, but for trending YoY, it's better to use the 1 year average and compare multiple years. 

  Download the Data **All_Geographies_Not_Tracts_Block_Groups.zip** (2018) and extract file to **data**
